// Package all registers every verification method type supported by this module, so that
// arbitrary DID documents (e.g. resolved through did:web) can be decoded.
//
// Import it for its side effect when you want document parsing to understand every
// verification method type, typically in tests or kitchen-sink tools:
//
//	import _ "github.com/ucan-wg/go-did-it/verifiers/methods/all"
//
// It pulls in every verification method package (and their key algorithm packages), so only
// this package pays that binary-size cost. For finer control, import only the verification
// method packages you expect. Note that decoding a key additionally requires its algorithm
// in the used crypto.KeyPolicy (see crypto/all).
