// Keys in did:plc, which are carried as did:key strings wherever they appear — rotation
// keys and verification methods alike. This file is the vocabulary: what a rotation key
// is, how one is written and read as a did:key, and whether a signer holds one. Applying
// a key policy to a whole operation's worth of them is the codec's job, in codec.go.

// Signer is a private key able to sign did:plc operations. It must be a secp256k1 or
// P-256 key, and must be one of the rotation keys of the state being signed.
//
// did:plc requires low-S signatures; this package always passes
// [crypto.WithEcdsaLowSSig] when signing.

// rotationKey is one entry of an operation's rotation key list, kept in both the forms the
// protocol needs at once. The index in the list is the key's authority: a lower index
// outranks a higher one, which is what makes recovery possible — see "Rotation keys and
// authority" in the package doc.
//
// A key is decoded exactly once, when its operation is parsed, and an operation whose
// rotation keys cannot all be decoded is rejected outright. That is what leaves the rules
// in chain.go needing no key policy of their own.
