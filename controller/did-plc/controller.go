// The public API. Each method is one move on the operation log described in the package
// doc:
//
//	Head        read the live path's last operation, and the state it established
//	Update      append an operation to the live path
//	Recover     fork the log at an earlier operation, nullifying the tail
//	Tombstone   append an operation that ends the DID
//	Audit       report the whole tree, forks included, after replaying it
//
// Update, Recover and Tombstone each read the current state first, so each is two round
// trips and neither is atomic; a competing operation in between makes the registry reject
// the second one.

// on that DID are built, signed and submitted.
